//! What only the browser test serves, with the app run as `SMOKE_TRUSTED_TYPES=1` (`app::for_the_smoke`):
//! a live stream whose one event is larger than a page's usual patch and is followed by nothing,
//! a page whose handler is given text with an apostrophe, quotes, `&` and `<` in it, as an
//! argument and as the value an element gives its ref, a patch drawn with this area's
//! stylesheet, which a form on a page outside the area is answered with, and a write that answers
//! with its own page.
